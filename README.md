# ML-DataPreprocessingTemplate
Welcome to my Data Preprocessing Template repository for Machine Learning! ðŸš€

This repository contains a comprehensive data preprocessing template to kickstart your Machine Learning projects. As you embark on your ML journey, you'll quickly realize that data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the success of your models. This template is designed to help you clean, transform, and prepare your raw data before feeding it into your ML algorithms.

Key Features:
Getting datasets <br>
Importing the libraries <br>
Importing the datasets <br>
Categorical data <br>
Splitting the dataset into training and testing set

Getting Started:
Download this repo on your device <br>
Make a seperate folder containing dataset and Python code <br>
Open it with spyder or other IDE <br>
import required libraries if not installed <br>
Run the program that's it

Happy Learning! ðŸŽ“ðŸ¤–
